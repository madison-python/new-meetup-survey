The survey responses have been deidentified and included in this repo as \"data/deidentified.csv\". Here I'm reading this csv in with `pandas`. The `read_csv()` function returns a `DataFrame` object. Just to get a sense of what the data look like, I print the column names and first three rows with the `head()` method available on all `DataFrame` objects."
